## Introduction

This is a basic CRUD application developed using React for the front-end and JSON Server for the backend. The application allows you to manage a collection of items with basic CRUD operations.

## Features

- Create new items
- Read existing items
- Update item details
- Delete items
- Utilizes React Router for navigation
- JSON Server is used to simulate a backend API

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-crud-app.git
   
Navigate to the project directory:
cd react-crud-app

Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:
npm install
# or
yarn install

## Usage
Start the JSON Server to simulate the backend API:
npm run server
# or
yarn server
This will start the JSON Server on port 5000 and use the db.json file as the data source.

Start the development server:
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
This will start the development server using Vite, allowing you to access the React app in your browser.

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.
